# Two Tier Flask App

## Overview- 
This project aims to deploy a scalable two-tier application running on Flask and MySQL, designed to handle 10,000 concurrent users while adhering to best DevOps practices. By leveraging Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS services, we ensure fault tolerance, scalability, and efficient deployment.

## Features
- The tasks undertaken to achieve the objective were multifaceted:
1. Containerizing the application using Docker.
2. Setting up a Kubernetes cluster with Kubeadm for initial deployment.
3. Transitioning the deployment to AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) for enhanced fault tolerance.
4. Packaging and deploying Kubernetes manifests using Helm.
5. Ensuring a high-availability setup with load balancing.
