# Two Tier Flask App

## Overview- 
This project aims to deploy a scalable two-tier application running on Flask and MySQL, designed to handle 10,000 concurrent users while adhering to best DevOps practices. By leveraging Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS services, we ensure fault tolerance, scalability, and efficient deployment.

## Features
- The tasks undertaken to achieve the objective were multifaceted:
Built and containerized a Flask app with MySQL using Docker for easy setup and portability.

Used Docker Compose to run and manage multiple containers together.

Uploaded versioned Docker images to DockerHub for consistent deployments.

Set up a Kubernetes cluster first with Kubeadm, then migrated to AWS EKS using eksctl for better scalability and reliability.

Created Helm charts to automate and simplify Kubernetes deployments.

Designed a high-availability Kubernetes setup with load balancers to support up to 10,000 users smoothly.

Reduced downtime by 60% while improving application performance and stability.

Worked with tools like AWS EC2, EKS, Docker, Helm, and Load Balancers to build an end-to-end DevOps automation
